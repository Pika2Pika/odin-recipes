    <h1>Odin Recipe Project</h1>
    <p>These are some of my favorite recipes.
     I am drooling all over my keyboard while in Git.
      I am excited to share them with you!

        I often start my day with a <a href="./recipes/PBJ.html">peanut butter and jelly sandwich</a>
        and a coffee. Around lunch, I want something light that won't 
        put me into a food coma (as much as I like those) so I can keep working! A 
        <a href="./recipes/Salad.html">salad </a> is my goto option. For dinner, 
        I'm ready to stuff my belly with a nice savory meal.<a href="./recipes/Spaghetti.html">Spaghetti</a>
        is very hard to beat. I can't handle the emotions that come with describing this food.
