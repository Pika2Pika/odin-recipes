    <h1>How I make peanut butter and jellies.</h1>

    <p>This is an all american classic. Hand's down. One of the best
        contribution america has given the world. A shame that most countries don't
        do peanut butter right, causing disdain from the international community. 
        Assuredly though, it is all their fault.

        The PB&J is a simple sandwich, requiring far less than what I am listing. 
        In my objective opinion though, this is what is required for the best 
        possible sandwich. 
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole grain bread, the one with all the seeds.</li>
            <li>Any peanut butter will do. </li>
            <li>Any jelly will do: 
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Blue berry</i></li>
                    <li><i>Grape</i></li>
                    <li><i>Peach</i></li>
                    <li><i>Raspberry</i></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Chia seeds</li>
            <li>Blueberries</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p> 
        Making the sandwich is just as <em>simple.</em>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare bread</li>
            <li>Spread peanut butter</li>
            <li>Spread jelly on other piece of bread</li>
            <li>Push blueberries into peanut butter</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chia seeds over jelly</li>
            <li>Combine.</li>
        </ol>

    </p>
    <p>You will realize you have made a very hefty sandwich. Enjoy king.</p>
